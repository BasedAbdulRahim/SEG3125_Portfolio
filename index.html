      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi! I'm <strong>Based Abdul Rahim</strong>, a driven and curious Software Engineering student at the University of Ottawa, currently working toward my bachelor's degree (2023–2027). I have a strong passion for building user-friendly digital experiences and exploring the intersection between technology, design, and usability.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through my coursework, I’ve developed a solid foundation in software design, computer architecture, operating systems, and user interfaces. I'm also fluent in multiple programming languages including Java, Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, with practical experience in software tools like Git, VSCode, Eclipse, Blender, and AutoCAD.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of academics, I enjoy gaming, retro aesthetics, and experimenting with digital art and interface layouts. These interests have inspired me to pursue UI/UX design more seriously — combining creativity and problem-solving to design for real people.
      </p>
      <p>
        Languages I speak: English, French, and Farsi. <br/>
        Current city: Ottawa, ON <br/>

  <!-- How I Work Section -->

      <h2>How I Work</h2>
      <p>
        As a student currently enrolled in <strong>SEG3125 – Human-Computer Interaction</strong> at the University of Ottawa, I’m actively learning core UI/UX concepts like usability heuristics, accessibility, user-centered design, and prototyping techniques. My design process is rooted in iteration — from early sketching to responsive front-end development using tools like Bootstrap 5, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this portfolio, I'm applying key principles of visual communication such as visual hierarchy, balance, and contrast — themes covered in our course readings and NN/g lectures. This page reflects not only my current skills but also my desire to grow as a thoughtful, user-first designer. As the semester progresses, I plan to document each of my projects with insights into my workflow, design decisions, and lessons learned.
      </p>
      <p>
        For external resources that influence my process, I often reference the <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/">Nielsen Norman Group</a>, <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/">Interaction Design Foundation</a>, and design communities such as Dribbble and Behance.
